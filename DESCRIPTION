Title: Ordered Lasso and Time-lag Sparse Regression
Version: 1.7
Author: Jerome Friedman, Xiaotong Suo and Robert Tibshirani
Description: Ordered lasso and time-lag sparse regression. Ordered Lasso fits a
    linear model and imposes an order constraint on the coefficients. It writes
    the coefficients as positive and negative parts, and requires positive
    parts and negative parts are non-increasing and positive. Time-Lag Lasso
    generalizes the ordered Lasso to a general data matrix with multiple
    predictors. For more details, see Suo, X.,Tibshirani, R., (2014) 'An
    Ordered Lasso and Sparse Time-lagged Regression'.
